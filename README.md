# QR Code Step-by-Step Generator
![QR Code Demonstration](header.png)

This program serves as a learning tool and demonstration platform for understanding the step-by-step generation of QR codes. It provides insights into the workings of QR codes and lets users visualize the entire process.

## Accessing the Program

1. **Executable Version**: If you wish to download the `.exe`, navigate to the `_export` folder in this repository.
2. **Web Version**: For a web-based experience, you can run the program directly in your browser from [my official website](https://sortofschool.org/tools/qr/qr).

## Important Notes
- Ensure to follow the process step-by-step. Skipping generation steps may lead to unexpected errors and an incorrect representation of the QR code.
- Built with [Godot v3.5.1](https://godotengine.org/)
- Supports only Version 1 of QR codes (21x21 matrix size)
- Currently operates only in byte-mode
